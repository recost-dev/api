# EcoAPI — API Reference

Base URL: `https://api.ecoapi.dev`

---

## Authentication

**Admin key** — pass as a Bearer token. Routes marked 🔒 require this.

```
Authorization: Bearer <admin-key>
```

**User JWT** — obtained via Google OAuth (`GET /auth/google`), pass as a Bearer token. Routes marked 🔑 require this.

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

Routes marked 🌐 are public.

---

## Auth

### 🌐 `GET /auth/google`
Redirects to Google's OAuth consent screen. Rate limited to 20 requests/IP/hour.

### 🌐 `GET /auth/google/callback`
OAuth callback — handled automatically by Google's redirect. On success, redirects to `https://ecoapi.dev/dashboard?token=<JWT>`. On failure (user denied access), redirects to `https://ecoapi.dev/auth/error?reason=denied` — the frontend must handle this route.

### 🔑 `GET /auth/me`
Returns the authenticated user's profile.

```json
{ "data": { "id": "...", "email": "...", "name": "...", "avatarUrl": "...", "isAdmin": false, "createdAt": "..." } }
```

### 🔑 `POST /auth/refresh`
Issues a fresh 7-day JWT. Send `Content-Type: application/json` with `{}` body. Returns `{ "data": { "token": "<new-JWT>" } }`.

## Telemetry (SDK → API)

### 🌐 `POST /projects/:id/telemetry`
Ingest a WindowSummary payload from the SDK. Called automatically by `@ecoapi/node` and `ecoapi` (Python) — you don't call this manually.

Returns `202 { "status": "accepted", "windowId": "..." }`.
